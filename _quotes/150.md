'"In the inspiration of mind and spirit that go into the making of Disney picture-making, one essential is clarity. The other is interest; if he is shown that it relates directly to his needs; if he is made eager to learn and learning becomes- as it can be one of the keenest of pleasures; then he will learn far more readily and surely than if he is forced to drudge along under the whip of compulsion or duty. Failure to make clear the nature and meaning of the thing being produced is one of the surest causes of dullness and failure to learn. The success of our movies has sprung from their universal appeal to millions of people of all nations, all ages, all degrees of experience, intelligence, and learning."'
