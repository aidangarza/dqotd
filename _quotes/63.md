I think we have made the fairy tale fashionable again. That is, our own blend of theatrical mythology. The fairy tale of film - created with the magic of animation-is the mode equivalent of the great parables of the Middle Ages. Creation is the word. Not adaptation. Not version. We can translate the ancient fairy tale into its mode equivalent without losing the lovely patina and the savor of its once-upon-a-time quality. I think our films have brought new adult respect for the fairy tale. We have proved that the age-old kind of entertainment based on the classic fairy tale recognizes no young, no old.
