'"I think of a newborn baby's mind as a blank book. During the first years of his life much will be written on the pages. The quality of the writing, whatever it be, will affect his life profoundly. Let us multiply that single mind by millions. What is written on that enormity of vouthful minds will alter the course of the world. This is how history is determined. It is self-evident to anybody who studies the history of the human race."'
