'"Before sitting down to count my blessings, I want to make you a promise. I promise we won't let this great honor you have paid us tonight go to our heads- we have too many projects for the future to take time out for such a thing. On top of that, after forty-some-odd years of ups and downs in this crazy business of ours, we know too well--you are only as good as your next picture."" (Taken from an awards speech)"'
