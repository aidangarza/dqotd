I was doing this Sorcerer's Apprentice with Mickey Mouse and I happened to have dinner one night with [Leopold] Stokowski. And Stokowski said, 'Oh, I'd love to conduct that for you.' Well, that led to not only doing this one little short subject but it got us involved to where I did all of Fantasia and before I knew it I ended up spending four hundred and some odd thousand dollars getting music with Stokowski. But we were in then and it was the point of no return. We went ahead and made it.
