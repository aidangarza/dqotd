'"A word may be said in regard to the concept and conduct of Disneyland's operational tone. Although various sections will have th fun and flavor of a carnival or amusement park, there will be none of the ""pitches,' game wheels, sharp practices, and devices designed to milk the visitor's pocketbook."'
