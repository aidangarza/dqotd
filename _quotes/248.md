All cartoon animals must be judged by their story intent and relationship as a matter of basic procedure in creating animation entertainment. Cartoon animals, of course, are not and never were replicas of real animals; they are a special breed of creatures out of the world of fable who duplicate human traits and foibles rather than those of the real animal kingdom. Mickey Mouse was never a mouse or anything like & mouse; no more than Donald was ever a duck.
