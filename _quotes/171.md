Humans learned life's lessons by seeing real things or pictures with their eyes for ages before they began learning through written or spoken words, so it is not strange that they still learn most readily by pictures. The animated cartoon can set forth anything from a world in evolution to the whirl of electrons invisible to human eyes; can produce a mosquito tall enough to tower over a village or a fairy small enough to dance on a leaf; can get inside a complex machine, slow down its action, explain its operation to apprentices with a clarity impossible in any other medium, and can even get inside the human body.
