Recently someone pointed out that in the past ten years we have produced fifty-two feature- length motion pictures, exactly twice the twenty-six features we made in our first three decades, since the day in 1923 when Roy and I went into business making cartoons. Those who have followed our progress know that this figure is typical of what our imaginative staffs have accomplished in recent years, in all areas of our company. The success of Mary Poppins and our other films, the worldwide attraction of Disneyland Park, the impact of our color program on network television, and the popularity of our four shows at the New York World's Fair- these things give us confidence that what we do continues to have strong appeal and acceptance by the public.
