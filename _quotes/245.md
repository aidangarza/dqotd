It's a thing I remembered as a kid. I saw Marguerite Clark in [Snow White] in Kansas City one time when I was a newsboy... . It was probably one of my first big feature pictures I'd ever seen... . But anyways, to me, I thought it was a perfect story. I had the sympathetic dwarfs, you see? I had the heavy; I had the prince and the girl, the romance. I just thought it was a perfect story.
