'"Educational films will never replace the teacher. The three Ris are basic (reading, 'riting, 'rithmetic), but their advancement by means of the motion-picture screen will give more people in this world an opportunity to learn. Pictures can make both teaching and learning a pleasure. And educators agree that when a student has begun to learn and like it, half their problem is solved."'
