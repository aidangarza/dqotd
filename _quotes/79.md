'2023-10-17,"If certain events continue, much of America's natural beauty will become nothing more than a memory. The natural beauty of America is a treasure found nowhere else in the world. Our forests, waters, grasslands and, wildlife must be wisely protected and used. I urge all citizens to join the effort to save America's natural beauty... it's our America do something to preserve its beauty, strength, and natural wealth."'
