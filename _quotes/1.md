There's a great feeling of satisfaction in winning an award for a job well done, whether it be for winning a footrace, designing a rocket, or making a motion picture. Now, we haven't done too well with the first two on the list, but pictures, that's something else. No one person can take credit for the success of a motion picture. It's strictly a team effort. From the time the story is written to the time the final release print comes off the printer, hundreds of people are involved each one doing a job-each job contributing to the final product. And, if the picture wins an award, the feeling of satisfaction we were speaking of can rightfully be shared by each and every one.
