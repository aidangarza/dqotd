'"We did not succumb to the alluring temptations to make villains or saints of the creatures portrayed in our [True-Life Adventure] films. We have maintained a sensitive regard for the wisdom of Nature's design and have attempted to hold a mirror to the ouf-of-doors rather than to interpret its tunctioning by man's standards. Our films have provided thrilling entertainment of educational quality and have played a major part in the worldwide increase in appreciation and understanding of nature. These films have demonstrated that facts can be as fascinating as fiction, truth as beguiling as myth, and have opened the eyes of young and old to the beauties of the outdoor world and aroused their desire to conserve priceless natural assets."'
