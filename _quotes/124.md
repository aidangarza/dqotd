The screen has too long been confined to what we can see and hear, what the camera can show... things which reveal not the half of a man's life and his most intense interests, with live actors attempting to interpret the unseen- the emotions, the impulses of the mind. And doing it, we must admit, rather clumsily most of the time. Relying largely on words often almost meaningless. Now, with the animated cartoon, we have another perfected tool- another scope for getting at the inner nature of things and projecting them for the eye and the ear.
