'"The immediate need for education and practice in using our natural resources of soil, forest, water, wildlife, and areas of inspirational beauty to the best advantage of all, for this generation and others to come, is again apparent to every observant citizen. My interest in these problems has been sharpened by our motion-picture production of wildlife subiects and the relation of animal life to all the other conservation issues during the past few years."'
