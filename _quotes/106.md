The success of the Silly Symphonies gave us the courage for Snow White. And you should have heard the howls of warning! It was prophesied that nobody would sit through a cartoon an hour and a half long. But, we had decided there was only one way we could successfully do it and that was to ao for broke shoot the works. There could be no compromise on money, talent, or time. We did not know whether the public would go for a cartoon feature but we were darned sure that audiences would not buy a bad cartoon feature.
