After a long concentration on live-action and cartoon films, we decided to try something that would employ about every trick we had learned in the making of films. We would combine cartoon and live action in an enormous fantasy Mary Poppins. And what a far cry that was from Snow White. As the original Mary Poppins budget of five million dollars continued to grow, I never saw a sad face around the entire studio. And this made me nervous. I knew the picture would have to gross ten million dollars for us to break even. But still there was no negative head-shaking. No prophets of doom. Even Roy was happy. He didn't even ask me to show the finished picture to a banker. The horrible thought struck me suppose the staff had finally conceded that I knew what I was doing.
