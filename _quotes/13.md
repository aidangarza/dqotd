We have done a lot of thinking on a model community, and I would like to be a part of building one, a city of tomorrow, as you might say. I don't believe in going out to this extreme blue sky stuff that some of the architects do. I believe people still want to live like human beings. But there are a lot of things that could be done. I'm not against the automobile but I just feel that you can design so that the automobile is there but still put people back as pedestrians again. I'd love to work on a project like that.
