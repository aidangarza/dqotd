'"Despite all the publicity about delinquency, America's youngsters are a pretty good lot. One of the things I want to do is make a picture that shows the good side of teenagers. I get so put out with all these pictures about delinquency. One picture upset me for three days afterward. I think these pictures are a mistake. Children get bad ideas when they see such things on the screen. And I don't think they show a true picture of young people today."'
