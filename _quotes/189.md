Sheer animated fantasy is still my first and deepest production impulse. The fable is the best storytelling device ever conceived, and the screen is its best medium. And, of course, animal characters have always been the personnel of fable; animals through which the foibles as well as the virtues of humans can best and most hilariously be reflected.
