Here we experience the story of our country's past... the colorful drama of Frontier America in the exciting days of the covered wagon and the stagecoach.. the advent of the railroad... and the romantic riverboat. Frontierland is a tribute to the faith, courage, and ingenuity of the pioneers who blazed the trails across America. (On Frontierland at Disneyland)
