'"People are always analyzing our approach to entertainment. Some reporters have called it the 'special secret of Disney entertainment. Well, we like a little mystery in our films, but there's really no secret about our approach. We're interested in doing things that are fun- in bringing pleasure and especially laughter to people. And we have never lost our faith in family entertainment stories that make people laugh, stories about warm and human things, stories about historic characters and events, and stories about animals."'
