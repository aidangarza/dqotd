My role? Well, you know I was stumped one day when a little boy asked, 'Do you draw Mickey Mouse?' I had to admit I do not draw anymore. Then you think up all the jokes and ideas? 'No,' I said, I don't do that. Finally, he looked at me and said, Mr. Disney, just what do you do? Well,'I said, 'sometimes I think of myself as a little bee. I go from one area of the studio to another and gather pollen and sort of stimulate everybody. I guess that's the job I do.'
