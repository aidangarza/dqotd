The whole thing here is the organization. Whatever we accomplish belongs to our entire group, a tribute to our combined effort. Look at Disneyland. That was started because we had the talents to start it, the talents of the organization. And our World's Fair shows- what we did was possible only because we already had the staff that had worked together for years, blending creative ideas with technical know-how.
