To try to keep an operation like Disneyland going you have to pour it in there. Its what I call Keeping the show on the road. Not iust new attractions, but keeping it staffed properly... you know, never letting your personnel get sloppy... . never let them be unfriendly. That's been our policy all our lives. My brother and I have done that and that is what has built our organization.
