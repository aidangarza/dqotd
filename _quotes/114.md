'"Everybody thinks that [Disneyland] is a gold mine but we have had our problems. You've got to work it and know how to handle it. Even trying to keep that park clean is a tremendous expense. And those sharp-pencil guys tell you, 'Walt, if we cut down on maintenance, we'd save a lot of money. But I don't believe in that- -it's like any other show on the road; it must be kept clean and fresh."'
