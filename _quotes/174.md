I actually started to plan [Snow White] about 1935. And I fooled around with it trying to get a hold of a story and things for a couple of years and finally it began to jell... . then I went to work on it and I finished in the fall of 1937. I didn't know what I had or what would happen or anything. We had the family fortune... we had everything wrapped up in Snow White. In fact the bankers, I think, were losing more sleep than I was. And fortunately, though, when we put it in and premiered it and everything else, why everything was fine and the bankers were happy.
