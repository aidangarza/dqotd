'"When youngsters get into serious trouble, it is generally the parents who are delinquent, not the children. If you will look a little deeper, when some unpleasant incident occurs, you'll find that there's usually something wrong in the domestic menage. In too many cases the parents are the ones who are in trouble, and the parents are the ones who need help."'
