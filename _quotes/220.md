'"Reporters are always analyzing our approach to entertainment, but there's no magic formula. I just make what I like warm and human stories, and ones about historic characters and events, and about animals. If there is a secret, I guess it's that I never make the pictures too childish, but always try to get in a little satire of adult foibles. Also, we do everything our own way, for ourselves, with no outside interference. We stay close to the fundamentals of family entertainment and recreation, and have complete voice in the marketing."'
