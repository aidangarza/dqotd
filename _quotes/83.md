Every man is captain of his career and there must be cooperation all around if he is to get what he wants out of life. There is no better time to begin learning this lesson than when we are young, and I think there is no better means of teaching it than through sports programs as well organized and supervised as Little League baseball. Baseball is a great teacher of an important secret of living: the giving and taking in the group, the development of qualities and behavior that will stand us in good stead through life in pursuits both personal and professional.
