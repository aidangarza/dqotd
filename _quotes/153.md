The motion picture still has great things ahead. Equipped with its big screens, its color and sound fidelities and all its perfected devices for illusionment, nothing is beyond its range and powers. Itself a marvel of science, it can and will serve with equal facility the space enthusiast looking beyond the sun, and the homebody content with the warm familiar earth and all its bounties when he goes with his family seeking entertainment and inspiration.
