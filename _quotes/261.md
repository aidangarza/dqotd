I've always had the feeling and l've always felt that there's a thing that schools should put more emphasis on... that is, how to research. I think it is what more students should know. Take even a lawver who's spent years in school. Where would he be without his library? I see writers who're supposed to be well-educated and everything else. You go in where they're working, you see all the different books they have around and everything else and the dictionaries they have there, the tools of their trade.'
