My big brother Roy was already in Los Angeles as a patient in the Veterans Hospital. When he got out, we had more in common than brotherly love. Both of us were unemployed... and neither could get a job. We solved the problem by going into business for ourselves. We established the first animated cartoon studio in Hollywood.
