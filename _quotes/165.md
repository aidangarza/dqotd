[Disneyland is] something that will never be finished. Something that I can keep developing, keep plussing and adding to. It's alive. It will be a live, breathing thing that will need change. A picture is a thing, once you wrap it up and turn it over to Technicolor you're through. Snow White is a dead issue with me. A live picture I just finished, the one I wrapped up a few weeks ago, it's gone, I can't touch it. There're things in it t don't like; I can't do anything about it. I wanted something alive, something that could grow, something I could keep plussing with ideas; the park is that. Not only can I add things, but even the trees will keep growing. The things will get more beautiful+ each year. And as I find out what the public likes and when a picture's finished and I put it out, I find out what the public doesn't like. I can't change it, it's finished, but I can change the park, because it's alive. That is why I wanted that park.
